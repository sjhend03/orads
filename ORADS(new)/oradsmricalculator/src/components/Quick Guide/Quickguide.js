                <h2>O-RADS MRI Governing Concepts:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>1. O-RADS MRI assumes an average risk patient with no acute symptoms. Clinical management directed by the treating physician would
supersede management recommendations based on imaging alone.</li>
                    <li>2. Categorize patient as pre- or postmenopausal (defined as â‰¥ 1 year amenorrhea).</li>
                    <li>3. In case of multiple or bilateral lesions, each lesion should be separately characterized, and management will be driven by lesion with highest
score.</li>
                    <li>4. Benign mature teratomas (dermoids): Characteristic benign mature teratoma (cystic lesions that contain macroscopic fat) may be scored as
O-RADS MRI 2, due to the very low risk of malignancy. Characteristic benign mature teratomas may contain septations or minimal
enhancement of Rokitansky nodules and these findings do not upgrade the lesion to O-RADS MRI Score 4. However, fatty adnexal lesions
that contain a large amount of enhancing soft tissue are classified as O-RADS MRI Score 4 due to risk of immature teratoma or other
malignant tissue.</li>
                    <li>5. Some characteristic lesions can be confidently diagnosed on MRI regardless of the O-RADS MRI Score category. In these cases, the final
radiological diagnosis can be reported (e.g. dysgerminoma, granulosa cell tumor, lymphoma, papillary serous tumors, peritoneal pseudocyst,
etc.).</li>
                    <li>6. Dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) with perfusion time intensity curves are preferred over non-dynamic DCE postcontrast imaging for risk
assessment. DCE time resolution should be of 15 seconds or less.</li>
                </ol>

Enhancing smooth septations, non-enhancing debris and fat are not solid tissue.</li>
                    <li>6. <b>Enhancement: </b>Increase in signal intensity on T1-weighted image after contrast injection. It is important to utilize subtracted images to evaluate for enhancement in a lesion that contains any high T1 signal.</li>

                    <br />
                    <p>Enhancement is assessed on a dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) acquisition or on a non-dynamic contrast MRI acquisition acquired at 30-40 seconds after contrast injection. Enhancement is defined as an increase in signal intensity after intravenous gadolinium-based contrast injection.</p>

                    <p><b>Is the fluid content simple or endometriotic?</b></p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The fluid within a cystic lesion can be either simple or non-simple, based on the observed signal intensity on T1 weighted images and T2 weighted images. Please see the table below for cystic fluid descriptor definitions.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Cystic lesions with simple or endometriotic fluid can be scored O-RADS MRI 2. Cystic lesions with other types of fluid are scored O-RADS MRI 3.</p>
